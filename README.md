This is a tool I'm working on to collect server information to keep it up to date. 

## Things I'd like to implement:
* Implement more collector functions to gather more information.
* Database with an API connection (idk if thats right, still learning)
* API to push scan information from the location to a central repository
* Web frontend to deliver the data in a dashboard of some kind.
